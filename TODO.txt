BIG TOPICS
==========


* clean up 9.5 "chossing your own cipher"

* DDOS possibilities when we increase cyrpto security?? What about that? (--> LATER)

* write a Justification section to every setting, maybe have that later in the document. 

* more focus on these sections:
  - GPG
  - SSH : do we need a client subsection? 

DONE * move the explanations to a later part of the document. Code snippets go *first* . The target group is sysadmins, must be easily copy & paste-able. Or find a different way so that they can easily use/read the document

DONE * Decide/Discuss recommended ciphers:
  - DH parameters: what is our recommendation? >2048? >=2048? leave default (aka 1024)?
  --> answer: we trust IETF/IKE  as described in ECRYPT2

* comments from IAIK integrate (--> Aaron, check again if it was done)
* SHA-1 section: write why it is a problem (--> Florian Mendel)
* PKI section (--> Thomas Schreck)
DONE * include OpenSSL names/IANA names into appendix (--> cm)
* Document RNG problem in Apache (--> Pepi)
DONE * Oracle ?? (--> Berg?? maybe . Or aaron: ask nic.at. Or link to T-Systems paper) --> T-Systems paper
DONE * DB2 (--> Berg. Or ask MLeyrer)
* Add AES128 to cipherStringA ?
* re-work chapter 2 (practical settings). Add lots of references to chapter 3 to get people interested in reading the theory.


Formatting
==========

DONE * one-column layout: make page margins smaller
DONE * add large "DRAFT" letters on top of every page.
DONE  make the git version number part of the document
DONE * Layout of sample code (lstisting format) : make it pretty!
Rendering in Firefox (inline) on Windows seems to be really messed up. What happenened?

* make every section like the Apache section (--> Aaron)

* make a HTML Version of the document. It is much easier to copy & paste from than from PDFs.
* Add Timestamp and git shorthash, not only date, to the title page of the document. Easier to check if you version of the document is current!


Workflow
========

* how to keep things up to date?
* how to automatically test  compatibility?
* how to make sure that this document has the latest information on cipher strengths?
* !! GPG sign every PDF !!
* store the keys in DNS: see RFC 4398


Contents
========
* scan our local region of the internet for https/smtp/imaps/pop3s

* Common Pitfalls: 
  - key generation
  - key management , key life cycle
  - cloning of VMs
  - common / default passphrases
* DH parameter?
* Further research
 - mysql, SMB, 
* Wish List for software vendors?
* sweet spot, wo koennen wir was sinnvoll machen, was waere zu viel (8192 bit keys...)


1. document the abstract needs that we have for the cipher settings (HSTS etc)
   Then find the best cipher setting strings per se
   Only then put it to all servers and keep it rather uniformely (as much as possible)

2. Test all settings 

* Test especially with non-Debian-OS!

* Test with more clients and other OSes than OSX / iPhone!!
--> clients? 
  - thunderbird
  - Apple Mail?
  - Outlook *
  - Playstation und XBox? --> LATER!
  - Lotus Notes
  - Blackberry*
  - Windows Phone 7 ???
  How to Test?
  - chapter owner makes a test setup
  - tested by: XXX , on: $date. Screenshot of SSLlabs/ $testtool. (checktls.com)

* document (cite) EVERYTHING! Why we chose certain values. References, references, references. Otherwise it does not count!
  Srsly!!
DONE * .bib file is completely wrong. Make good citations/references. Add books: Schneier, ...
* !! important: add the version string to everything that we tested!!

* two target groups:
  - security specialists / freaks who want the very best settings
  - should as many clients work with the settings as possible
* look at TLS1.2 specs and really check if we want all of these settings


Practical settings section
----------
Definitely still missing these subsubsections:
* Exchange Server ??  (--> bei M$ angefragt, Evtl. Beitrag von A-Trust)
  - SMTP, POP, IMAP
DONE * Exim4 (-> Adi & Wolfgang Breya)
DONE * Checkpoint (-> cm)
* Asa / Palo Alto (-> Azet)
* Terminal Server (VNC ), ??
DONE * Squid
DONE * XMPP
  --> verweise auf die xmpp community bzw. auf xmpp.net verweisen.
  Empfehlung: unbedingt ejabberd updaten!!

RNDG section
------------
DONE - add two, three sentences
DONE - mention HaveGED 
DONE - embedded devices are a problem



Contacting / who?
=================
* Juniper
* Cisco
* Leithold

Formats to export
=================
Requested by many people on Twitter
    * Plain TXT version for use on headless servers
    * HTML version for better reading in browsers and always up-to-date
    * EPUB version for comfortable reading on tablets and ebook readers

LATER / further 
================
* OpenLDAP (-> Adi)
* Radius
* Windows Active Directory
* SRP: not part of this document
DONE * \cipherA , \cipherB setting ---> does not work in our \begin{listing} environment --> maybe there is a different listing environment or use awk/sed/make/perl/python
* What about 3270 terminal emulation? How to do crypto there? Can we? ( --> IBM sec. Stammtisch. Aaron)
